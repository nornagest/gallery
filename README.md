This is a Mojolicious based web gallery.  I have been using a gallery that was using jQuery but I wanted to remove that dependency.  That gallery was gallerific by Trent Foley ( http://jquery.kvijayanand.in/galleriffic/ ).

I found that some basic Perl code would give me something very close to the original gallery.  I am really pleased with how it turned out.
